This was my 2nd year Software Engineering project which was done with my lecturer's preferred coding style/structure.
It is an Airline System. Its purpose was to allow airport administrators to schedule flights between existing airports.
After the flight is scheduled it can then be booked by a passenger.
This was my first time using C# to connect to an existing database on Visual Studio (NOT Visual Studio Code).
I had so much fun coding up this project. However, from time to time I got frustrated that I could not solve my existing problem/issue.
